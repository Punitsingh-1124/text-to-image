Text to Images Generator:
This project is a web application that allows users to generate images from text descriptions using AI. The application utilizes the Stable Diffusion model from Hugging Face to create unique artworks based on user input.

Features

1.User - Friendly Interface: Enter a description in a text area and click the "Generate Image" button to create an image.

2.Image Generation: The application communicates with the Stable Diffusion API to generate images based on the provided text prompt.

3.Download Option: Once the image is generated, users can download it directly to their device.

How It Works:

Enter a prompt in the text input field.
Click the "Generate Image" button.
The application sends the prompt to the Stable Diffusion API and retrieves the generated image.
The image is displayed on the page, and a download button appears for users to save the image.
